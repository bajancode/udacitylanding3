# Udacity Landing Page Submission 1

## Project Description
This page was made to fulfill the Udacity Front End NanoDegree second project, it's very basic and this version is very minimal. The focus is on adding/removing active states dynamically. 

## Usage & Dependencies  
Nothing to install and no dependencies, simply download the code and open index.html in any modern web browser

### Credit
Please note that I learned about and used most of the isInViewport function from the following source, which [Udacity knowledge says](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/85408) we are able to use in our project: https://gist.github.com/davidtheclark/5515733

I also deepened my understanding via a similar function from [JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/check-if-an-element-is-visible-in-the-viewport/) 

Thank you!
