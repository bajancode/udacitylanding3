# Udacity Landing Page Submission 1

## Project Description
This page was made to fulfill the Udacity Front End NanoDegree second project, it's very basic and this version is very minimal. The focus is on adding/removing active states dynamically. 

## Usage & Dependencies  
Nothing to install and no dependencies, simply download the code and open index.html in any modern web browser

### Credit
Please note that I learned about and used most of the isInViewport function from the following source, thank you [JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/check-if-an-element-is-visible-in-the-viewport/) !  

### Notes to self
Sometimes the section inviewport doesn't work so need to get out of developer tools and inspect, I imagine that's a viewport thing but may need to fix if it has implications for smaller browsers / change the sizing of the sections for demo purposes. Also need to make navbar sticky and add 4 sections.  And the bigger question about how to iterate through arrays with a helper function to make it cleaner, if that's possible (Return/console.log/outputs), and use a function as a variable etc to achieve these means...may be more playing around
